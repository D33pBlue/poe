# ![logo](icon.png)Proof of Evolution (PoE)
Demonstrative implementation of a new consensus protocol for blockchains.
This protocol allows the execution of user-defined *Genetic Algorithms* (GAs) while mining,
keeping all the security properties of PoW.




## Motivation
Proof of Work (PoW) is still one of the most used consensus protocols in blockchains, because of its security properties. However, in order to keep the system working, it requires a huge amount of computations, that results in a huge energy consumption. For this reason, new consensus protocols have been developed since the birth of Bitcoin, to make blockchains more sustainable.


These alternative consensus protocols can be subdivided in two cathegories:
- The ones that reduce the amount of computation requested in mining (For example *Proof of Stake*,*Proof of Space*,*Proof of Elapsed Time*).
- The ones that do not reduce the computations, but that earmark part of them for useful tasks (For example *Proof of Useful Work*, *Proof of Learning*, *Proof of Search*).


In any case, few of these protocols can guarantee the same security properties of PoW. Their security is based on different assumptions and should be evaluated in the application context.


PoE, instead, can be seen as an extension of PoW (in a way similar to Proof of Search), that keeps all the security properties of PoW unchanged and, at the same time, allows the execution of GAs during mining. These GAs can be submitted by users through transactions, and thus be useful for someone.
